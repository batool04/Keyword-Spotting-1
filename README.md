# TinyMLKit Projectâ€”Building a Voice Command CONTROL of Screen using Keyword Spotting

Edge Impulse gives programmers the tools they need to build the next wave of embedded machine learning solutions for intelligent devices.
See here for instructions how to burn code of keyword spotting to distinguish auditory events, particularly your speech, even when there is background chatter or other noise.  Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is a tiny development board with a Cortex-M4 microcontroller,
